# Affoltern Banani Raubzug

## User Directives (Durable)

These are the user's standing preferences — persist across all sessions,
autonomous or manual. Update only when the user explicitly changes them.

- **Scope target**: Bloons TD-style depth, in a small Swiss-German
  package. No scope is "too big" if justified — ship it in slices.
- **Subscription**: Claude Max → use parallel Sonnet subagents freely,
  use Opus 4.7 for planning and architecture, Sonnet 4.6 for execution.
- **Review appetite**: none. Do not ask the user to review PRs. The
  autonomous loop auto-merges validated changes. User manages from
  phone via GitHub mobile.
- **Do NOT ask the user to trigger workflow runs manually.** They
  hate that. Make workflows trigger themselves on push, or daisy-chain
  via `workflow_run` events, or use `repository_dispatch`. If something
  needs a one-shot execution, do it yourself (push a dummy commit,
  open a PR, etc). Never say "please click Run workflow on your phone".
- **Be maximally productive and proactive every session.** Ship as
  much as fits. Generate new ideas, don't wait for the user to ask.
  When you finish one fix, immediately pick up the next meaningful
  thing from ROADMAP or CI-failure issues and keep going. Write code,
  don't ask permission. The user prefers too much progress over too
  little ceremony.
- **Read your own CI failures.** The `ci-monitor.yml` workflow files
  a GitHub Issue with log tails whenever any workflow fails. Before
  starting new work, check `mcp__github__list_issues` with label
  `ci-failure` and fix those first. Close the issue when fixed.
- **When the user drops a photo in chat for a new character icon**,
  DO NOT ask them to open a GitHub Issue. Save the photo directly to
  `.github/friend_photos_inbox/<slug>.jpg` (pick a short slug from any
  name they mention), optionally write a sidecar `<slug>.yml` with
  `name`, `description`, `style` (default / warrior / scholar / pirate
  / pixie / punk). Commit + push. The `photo-inbox.yml` workflow
  handles the rest (Stability AI img2img → new asset → PR).
- **Feedback rhythm**: user plays the deployed HTML5 build
  (`jgschobel.github.io/Tower-Defense-Game/`) and edits `ROADMAP.md`
  when they want to redirect priorities. Otherwise: zero input required.
- **Language**: game content in Swiss German (Züridütsch), code and
  commit messages in English.
- **Platform**: mobile landscape 1280×720, touch-first, GL Compatibility
  renderer. Also deploys to web via GitHub Pages for on-phone testing.
- **Aesthetic**: friends' faces as towers (Lemurius, Kühne, JoJo,
  Cordula, Amösius), vegan food enemies, De Vegan-Tüüfel as the
  antagonist. Migros Affoltern as world.

## Project Overview
A **landscape** (1280x720) tower defense game built in **Godot 4.6** using GDScript. Set in Migros Affoltern, Zürich. 5 tower characters (Lemurius, Kühne, JoJo, Cordula, Amösius) fight cursed vegan products controlled by De Vegan-Tüüfel. All text in Swiss German. Procedural chiptune music + SFX, AI-generated art, story cutscenes, 3 levels with 10 waves each.

## Tech Stack
- **Engine**: Godot 4.6 (GL Compatibility renderer for mobile)
- **Language**: GDScript
- **Target**: Mobile (landscape 1280x720), touch controls
- **Renderer**: GL Compatibility (not Vulkan) for max device support

```

## Architecture
- **Autoloads**: `GameManager` (game state, save/load, lives, levels) and `CurrencyManager` (gold economy) are global singletons
- **Data-driven design**: Tower types, enemy types, and levels are defined as Godot `Resource` (.tres) files — add new content by creating new .tres files, no code changes needed
- **Scene composition**: Base scenes (base_tower.tscn, base_enemy.tscn) are reused with different data resources attached
- **Signal-based communication**: Systems communicate via signals, not direct references

## Coding Conventions
- **GDScript style**: Follow Godot's official GDScript style guide
- **Naming**: snake_case for variables/functions, PascalCase for classes, UPPER_SNAKE for constants/enums
- **Type annotations**: Use explicit types for function parameters and return values
- **Signals**: Use simple types (int, String, Node2D, Resource) in signal parameter types — avoid custom class_name types in signal declarations as they can cause parse-order issues
- **Typed arrays**: Use `Array` (untyped) instead of `Array[CustomClass]` when the custom class is defined via class_name, to avoid parse-order dependencies
- **No trailing commas** in function call arguments
- **Enum values**: Avoid using names that could conflict with GDScript keywords (e.g., use `PURE` instead of `TRUE`)

## Important Patterns
- **Adding a new tower**: Create a new .tres file in `resources/tower_data/` using the TowerData resource type, add its ID to `_shop_tower_ids` in hud.gd
- **Adding a new enemy**: Create a new .tres file in `resources/enemy_data/`, then reference its ID in level wave definitions
- **Adding a new level**: Create `resources/level_data/level_N.tres`, optionally create `scenes/game/level_N.tscn`
- **Friend photos**: Assigned via FriendPhotoManager UI, stored in `user://photos/`, mapped by character_id in GameManager

## Common Pitfalls
- Enemies are `PathFollow2D` nodes — they must be children of a `Path2D` to work
- The `DetectionArea` on towers uses `body_entered`/`body_exited` — enemies need a physics body to be detected
- Autoloads reference each other (GameManager ↔ CurrencyManager) — ensure both are registered in project.godot
- When using `.bind()` on signal connections, bound args come AFTER the signal's own args in the callback

## AI Agent Architecture
This project uses a multi-agent workflow. See `AGENTS.md` for full details.

- **Conductor (Opus)** — architecture, code, creative, git, user communication
- **Art Factory (Sonnet, background)** — image generation via Stability AI, background removal, batch processing
- **Code Scout (Sonnet, on-demand)** — codebase exploration, file searches, path validation
- **Build Tester (Sonnet, pre-push)** — validates signal connections, file paths, node references

API keys stored at `C:/Users/josef/.api_keys/keys.json` (outside repo).

## Common Pitfalls
- Enemies are `PathFollow2D` nodes — they must be children of a `Path2D` to work
- Tower `DetectionArea` uses `area_entered`/`area_exited` to detect enemy `HitBox` Area2D — NOT body_entered
- Autoloads reference each other (GameManager ↔ CurrencyManager) — ensure both are registered in project.godot
- When using `.bind()` on signal connections, bound args come AFTER the signal's own args in the callback
- Use simple types in signal declarations (Node2D, Resource, int) not custom class_name types

## Build & Run
- Open in Godot 4.6+
- Main scene: `res://scenes/ui/main_menu.tscn`
- Mobile export: use the Android or iOS export templates with GL Compatibility
