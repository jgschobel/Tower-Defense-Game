# Roadmap — Affoltern Banani Raubzug

The autonomous dev loop reads this file every 6 hours and picks the
highest-priority unchecked item matching the current run mode.

**Priority order**: P0 (blocking) → P1 (important) → P2 (nice-to-have).
Within a priority, top-of-list wins.

---

## 🔥 P0 — Blocking / Bugs

- [x] Fix JoJo splash tower `can_target_flying = true` (PLAN #12)
- [ ] DamageType enum actually applied in base_enemy.gd (magic ignores armor, physical reduced by armor) — PLAN #16
- [x] Show feedback text on invalid tower placement ("Z'nöch am Wäg!" / "Z'nöch am Turm!") — PLAN #24
- [x] Tower cost affordability color (yellow/gold affordable, red unaffordable) — PLAN #28
- [x] Floating `+gold` labels don't disappear when monster dies (tween was self-bound to freed enemy)
- [x] Death SFX was grating noise burst — replaced with soft 180→70Hz sweep at 0.15 volume
- [ ] Story screen rework — multi-page dialogue boxes instead of one cramped panel. User reports text is too small to read and skips show immediately. Bloons/Monaco-style typewriter across 3-5 pages with big tap-to-advance buttons. Swiss German content unchanged, presentation rebuilt.
- [ ] **Options menu** (music volume, SFX volume, master volume) accessible from main menu AND pause menu. Use AudioServer buses: add "Music" and "SFX" buses, route MusicManager/SfxManager players through them, expose sliders that call `AudioServer.set_bus_volume_db`.
- [ ] Enemy pathing bug: at level 2+, enemies stack up at spawn in a long vertical line before moving. Visible in screenshot — 10+ tofu-würschtli piled on top of each other at the top-left corner. Likely a spawn cadence/path-follow issue in `wave_manager.gd` or `base_enemy.gd`.

## 🎨 P0 — Map Backgrounds (each level needs real personality)

The current level backgrounds are a single static image that feels flat.
Each level should have: a bespoke parallax layer, thematic foreground
props, ambient particles, and time-of-day atmosphere. Use `generate-art`
mode to produce tier-2 quality assets; wire them in during `build-content`.

- [ ] **Level 1 — Migros Affoltern Eingang**: parallax sliding-doors,
  shopping carts in background, self-scan area props, midday bright
  neon-fluorescent lighting, Migros-orange color accents.
- [ ] **Level 2 — D'Tiefchüel-Abteilig (Freezer Aisle)**: dripping
  icicles (animated), frost-fog particle layer, vertical freezer doors
  as parallax columns, cold blue lighting, occasional breath-mist from
  towers.
- [ ] **Level 3 — D'Bäckerei vom Gruse**: warm oven glow, flour
  particle drift, baguette/gipfeli props, warm amber lighting, bread
  racks in background.
- [ ] Level 4+ pending — see Content section. Each needs the same
  bespoke treatment: props, parallax, particles, lighting.

## 🔥 P0 — The Big Feature: Bloons-TD-5-style branching upgrades

The single biggest gap to Bloons TD. Each tower should have **two upgrade
paths**, visually distinct at each tier, with meaningfully different
mechanics. This is the core progression loop of BTD. Attack as a multi-
run project:

- [ ] **Data model**: extend `tower_data.gd` with `upgrade_path_a` and
  `upgrade_path_b` arrays (each has 3 tiers), plus `current_path_a_tier`
  and `current_path_b_tier` runtime state per tower. Max 2/0 or 0/2 per
  tier rule (one path must stay at tier 2 before the other can reach 3).
- [ ] **UI**: tower info panel shows two upgrade columns instead of one
  linear button. Icons + cost + Swiss German name per tier.
- [ ] **Visual feedback**: tower texture swaps per tier (use
  `generate-art` mode to produce tier-2 and tier-3 variants for each
  character; while art is pending, tint/outline/particle effects
  indicate tier).
- [ ] **Lemurius paths**: Schnelli Banane (attack speed) vs. Scharfi Banane
  (damage) → tier-3 merger: Explosivi Khaki (AoE bomb)
- [ ] **Kühne paths**: Giftige Pollen (poison DoT) vs. Iis-Blüete (freeze)
  → Füür-Lilie (AoE fire over time)
- [ ] **JoJo paths**: Stärcheri Formel (damage) vs. Chaos-Chemie
  (random effects) → Lotter JoJo (random legendary)
- [ ] **Cordula paths**: Volleyball Hagel (multi-shot) vs. Ankerhake
  (stun) → Party Kanone (massive AoE)
- [ ] **Amösius paths**: Längeri Zunge (range) vs. Chläbrigeri Zunge
  (stronger slow) → Insta-Reel Attacke (pull-and-hold)

## 💡 Ideas To Explore

*Added by the `ideate` mode runs. The loop mines this section for bigger
creative swings. Lift to P1 when ready to ship.*

- [ ] **Glace-Schlag tower** — Migros ice-cream themed, freezes all
  enemies in 200px radius for 3s, 15s cooldown, 400 gold.
- [ ] **MOAB-class boss: "De Grossi Coop-Güggel"** — rival supermarket
  mega-boss in Level 10 / endless, 8000 HP, spawns 4 soja_steak on death,
  gives 800 gold.
- [ ] **Camo enemies** (invisible unless a sniper tower is within range)
  — thematic fit: "Schatte-Tofu", sneaky ninja tofu.
- [ ] **Combo multiplier** — rapid kills within 2s build a combo that
  gives bonus gold and a tiny UI streak counter.
- [ ] **Sandbox mode** — unlimited gold, unlock all towers, any level,
  for experimenting. One extra button on level-select.

## For the Autonomous Loop

**When you complete an item**: tick the box `[x]`, add one line to
`CHANGELOG.md`, and commit both changes with your PR.

**When you add a new idea**: drop it under the right priority bucket with
a clear one-liner. Link to any related PLAN.md item number if relevant.

**When nothing fits today's mode**: do a tiny polish PR (a typo, a
constant rename for clarity, a missing type annotation). Never open an
empty PR.
